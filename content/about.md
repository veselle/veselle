Hello. If you're seeing this, you're likely here from my Discord profile or somewhere else. This post's here to make a few things clear about myself.

- I am "Vee", or "veselle".
- I use she/her pronouns.
- I am very noise sensitive.
- I do not like social media.
- I prefer to be left alone.
- I may come off as cold at times.
- I only want to be messaged or pinged for important things.
- I have a very low social battery. I may not respond immediately.
- I do not wish to be "depended on", "checked up on", or anything similar.

If I don't know you that well, I won't be accepting a friend request.
